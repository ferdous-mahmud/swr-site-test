Almost 2 years ago I need to support to `different version of Xcode`. On the time I use `two different Mac` for different version. But it was pain for me and there was a easy solution for it. The process are very simple to follow. You don't need
another mac. You can support various version of Xcode using `same Mac`.

### Forget about old way

- **Download** your desired version of `Xcode` form [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10335747/how-to-download-xcode-dmg-or-xip-file)

- When download finished `unzip` the zip **file** 
- Now simply drag and drop `Xcode.app` file to your **applications** folder
- First time opening the Xcode app it will automaticly download some additional components
- That's was the `pro` way to download and install Xcode


### Let's know when you need multiple version of Xcode

Different release of Xcode comes with `new features` and different version of `swift`:

| Xcode series    | Swift     | Features    |
| --------------- | ----------| ------------|
| `10.x`          | `4.2`     | `Dark Mode` |
| `11.x`          | `5.1`     |  `SwiftUI`  |
| `12.x`          | `5.3`     |      `_`    |
| `13.x`          | `5.5`     |`Aaymc await`|


### Xcode is a directory

- Because Xcode is a `directory`, we can support multiple version
- Simply `rename` (i.e. **Xcode-13.app**)
- Then unrename to Xcode the version you want  to use
- Make it **Xcode.app**
- Now enjoy ðŸš€
